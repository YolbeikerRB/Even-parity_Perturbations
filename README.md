# Stability of generalized Einstein-Maxwell-scalar black holes

In this notebook, we introduced the Lagrangian coefficients as a crucial tool for investigating the stability of static black holes within generalized Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories, particularly under even-parity perturbations. 

These coefficients lay the foundation for delving into a comprehensive analysis of the stability of static spherically symmetric black holes under the influence of linear even-parity perturbations.

This mathematical notebook serves as a valuable supplement to the research paper: [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP02%282022%29020), [arXiv:2112.00109](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00109)
